# UUID-GEN
A very simple Python script that writes a requested number of UUID's to a text file with one UUID per line.
## Usage
This script is very lightweight & uses no dependencies. Simply run the script with ``python3 UUIDGenerator.py`` & follow the on-screen prompts to recieve your desired output.
## Options
### UUID Count
The desired number of UUID's to be generated. Simply input the amount you require and press enter. **It is not recommended to go over a count of 10,000. However, device performance may differ.**
### Output Type
**This input has two possible options:**<br>
```Regular```: Write the requested UUID's to a file along with details such as the total count & date of generation.<br>
```Quiet```: Writes the requested UUID's to a file but leaves out everything else included with the "Regular" option.<br>
